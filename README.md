# Arduino Uno Q Garden Board Brick

With the Arduino Uno Q having the ability to use Bricks, which make it easier to make more complex programs using Python, it allows the possibility for easier access to data coming from the Garden Boards without needing a ESP32 acting a bridge.

> [!NOTE]
> This is experimental while I find the best way to communicate from the Garden Board to an Arduino Uno Q, such as using a MQTT or Wi-Fi access point method
